Freshwork CMS: Why another framework cms?

We are updating this wiki documentation weekly or even daily. Freshwork CMS it's an Open Source Project licensed GPLv2.

We build this project as an alternative to other PHP Content Management Systems and Frameworks like Wordpress, Joomla, CakePHP and so on. We want to join the best features of every software and create a very simple to use, but powerful tool to develop amazing apps and websites like no other.

For example, we use the power of the hooks & filters, to make our plugins take advantage of the great features the Wordpress plugins have. Also we use models like the CakePHP's models so you can query your personalized database tables in an structured and extremely ease way.

Like any other Open Source Project, we need you help to continuously upgrade the core and the features of the system.

This Github project it's the main channel to organize the entire development of the project. We highly appreciate any feedback you have :)
